# Hackless 🛠️
A portable fully server-sided basic system to prevent cheating in my favorite lego game (Roblox).

## Some Features 👀
1. Fully server-sided: Benefits to this include- You can't just use `.Disabled = true` 👍
2. Actually good for CFrame detection (sometimes) 😱
3. Will maybe be receiving useful updates in the future ✅
4. Coded very nicely, uses modules handled in the server, and more 💰
5. Introduces functions that make it insanely user-friendly, for modding 😉

## Downsides 😔
1. Doesn't account for purposeful teleports, speed modifications, and more.. 🥲
2. I do know of a few bypass methods that involve teleporting and speed modifications 😡
3. Written by a 16 year old that has no idea what he's doing ❓

In all seriousness, you shouldn't use this as a generic product. This is more of a fun and silly project to help with very basic cheating prevention, I still find it very cool how this all works, and it took me a few hours to write, but in the end, it was all worth it.

If you want to support me and my work, feel free to star this, or any repository of mine! Stars help me stay motivated and I'll really appreciate ya for it. 💖
